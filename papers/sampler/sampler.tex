\title{A custom Monte Carlo sampler
  for binary-star and exoplanet radial velocity data}
\author{APW, DWH, DFM, others}

\begin{abstract}
% Context
Given sparse radial-velocity measurements of a star, there are often
many qualitatively different stellar or exoplanet companion orbit
models that are consistent with the data.
The consequent multimodality of the likelihood function leads to
extremely challenging search, optimization, and MCMC posterior
sampling in the space of orbital parameters.
% Aims
Here we create a custom-build Monte Carlo sampler that can produce a
posterior sampling for orbital parameters given even small numbers of
noisy radial-valocity measurements (and hence very complex likelihood
function).
The goal is to obtain provably correct samplings in the space of
orbital parameters.
% Methods
We capitalize on the similarity between orbit fitting and linear
sinusoid fitting, where we can---at any given orbital
period---generate a perfect sampling because of the problem structure.
We transform the perfect samplings in the linear problem into a
perfect sampling in the real orbital problem using importance
sampling.
% Results
We find that we can quickly produce correct samplings in orbital
parameters for data sets that include as few as three noisy time
points.
Although the method produces correct samplings by construction, the
method becomes inefficient (at the importance sampling stage) when the
eccentricity becomes large, because in this case the linear and real
problems diverge substantially.

\section{Introduction}

Precise radial-velocity measurements of stars have transformed
astrophysics in the last decades:
They have permitted the discovery of the first planets around other stars,
including especially the unanticipated but common hot jupiters,
and been used to discover or confirm hundreds
(perhaps thousands?) of planets.
Radial velocity measurements have also been used to find substellar,
degenerate, and black-hole companions to more normal stars, and hold
the promise of delivering the full population statistics for binary
(and trinary) star systems.

With many new stellar spectroscopic surveys operating or under
construction, we expect to have good quality spectra for millions
of stars in the next few years.
Most of these surveys have at least some targets---and many have many
targets---that get observed multiple times.
These surveys can (as an auxilliary or primary goal of their observing
strategies) generate discoveries of planetary, substellar, and stellar
companions.
These discoveries, in turn, will feed population inferences, follow-up
programs, and projects to refine precise stellar models.

However, when radial-velocity observations are not designed with
unambiguous detection and discovery in mind, usually there are
multiple possible binary-star models that are consistent with any
small number of radial-velocity measurements that show stellar
acceleration.
That is, a small number of (even very good) radial velocity
measurements will lead to posterior beliefs about companion orbits and
masses that put substantial plausibility onto multiple qualitatively
different solutions, or (in other words) create a likelihood function
that is highly multi-model in the relevant parameter spaces.
There are currently no safe methods known for exploring these highly
multimodal functions and delivering correct posterior samplings and
reliable probabilistic statements about detection and
characterization.

Here we make an attempt at correcting these problems.
Our approach is to build custom posterior sampling methods that
capitalize on the structure of the binary-star (or star--exoplanet)
kinematics to create provably---or highly probably---correct
samplings.

The structure of the paper is as follows:
We state clearly our assumptions, and demonstrate that we have a
method that is correct under those assumptions.
We perform experiments with the method to understand its properties
and limitations.
We finish by discussing the value of the method, and the changes we
would have to make if we weakened our assumptions, or if we don't
weaken our assumptions but they indeed prove to be far from correct.

\section{Assumptions and method}

In order to set up a well-posed problem and build a path to a
definite solution, we make a set of non-trivial assumptions about the
stellar systems we are observing.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gaussianity and independence with known variances.
\item Only zero or one component, single-line, unconaminated stellar spectrum.
\item Kepler problem is an accurate description.
\item Priors.
\end{enumerate}

We have three options at this point: (1) just run the fucking MCMC and make sure it converges, (2) do the solvable problem (single siusoid) and important sample down to the correct problem (the full Kepler problem), or (3) Monte Carlo sample the nonlinear parameters after marginalizing out the linear parameters.
